- Exercise given:

Make a Python program that simulates an ATM, which will allow you to make cash withdrawals, check the account balance, deposit the balance to the user's account, buy cell phone recharges for the companies Altice, Claro and Viva generating a random number 5-digit recharge. You must validate that no more of the funds can be withdrawn. 

Include login to verify the user's credentials and their PIN, managed with MENU and easy navigation, which allows moving back and forth in the different transactions. For the functionality of the Login, you must store both the User Identifiers and each PIN in a text file, so that it allows reading if the user exists and if the PIN is correct.

- Comments:

So basically you can see what i did on main.py file. The 3 .txt files works as a DB so you must have those 3 files in order for the program to work.
